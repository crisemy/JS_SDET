/* 
Create a function that does the following:
- The function must take 2 numbers. A start and an end.
- The function should check each number in the range given to see if it meets one of these criteria:
    - If the number is divisible by 3 print out "Fizz"
    - If the number is divisible by 5 print out "Buzz"
    - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out "FizzBuzz"
    - If none of the above is true then just print the number
*/

/* PSEUDO CODING:

    endNumber = 10
