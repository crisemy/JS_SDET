- Go to the ESLint extention in order to install it locally or globally.
There're instructions there. Also get this link -> https://eslint.org
I'm gonna install it globally:
npm install -g eslint

NOTE from the Extension Document : On new folders you might also need to create an .eslintrc configuration file. You can do this by either using the VS Code command Create ESLint configuration or by running the eslint command in a terminal with npx eslint --init.

NOTE: Return some day to this because is NOT gonna work. I'm in the middle of the conf so far.
